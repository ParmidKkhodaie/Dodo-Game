# Dodo-Game
This game is about a kingfisher bird that has to catch fish. If it hits octopuses, crabs, or jellyfish, it gets shocked (score decreases). If it collides with anemones or corals (obstacles), the game is over. I hope you enjoy playing the game! Please note: this game is designed for desktop and is not optimized for mobile devices.
